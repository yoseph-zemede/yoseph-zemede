# Yoseph Zemede

I’m a Data Scientist and ML Engineer focused on the intersection of statistical modeling and scalable software architecture. I spend most of my time building models that extract signal from noisy data and deploying them into production environments.

### 🔬 Selective Projects

**[National Health Data Analytics](https://github.com/yourusername/project-link)**
Developed a comparative analysis tool to identify correlations in national health indicators. Focused on handling missing data and normalizing disparate datasets to ensure accurate year-over-year comparisons.

**[NLP News Summarization](https://github.com/yourusername/project-link)**
Built a system to process and summarize high-volume text data. I implemented custom keyword extraction and used LLM APIs to generate concise summaries, optimizing for semantic accuracy while minimizing latency.

**[Recipe Discovery Engine](https://github.com/yourusername/project-link)**
A mobile-first application using a Firebase backend. I focused on the data schema and building a recommendation layer that suggests content based on historical user interactions.

### 🔭 Current Interests
Right now, I'm diving deeper into **MLOps**—specifically looking at model monitoring and handling data drift in production. I'm also experimenting with local LLM deployments and fine-tuning techniques for specialized domain tasks.
